We have already established the connection to the `radical.db` database and created a `ninja_turtles` table.  We need to write migrations to make adjustments to our database schema, which are outlined below.\n",

    "Remember to 1) run `alembic init alembic` in your terminal to initialize the Alembic environment, and 2) change the `sqlalchemy.url` in the `alembic.ini` file to point to our database, `sqlite:///radical.db`.  Also, after executing the migrations, remember to update the models in `models.py` to match the new database schema.  Make sure to write `__init__` constructor functions for each model as well.\n",

    "In this lab, we practiced using alembic to create and execute our migrations. We added columns, tables, and we also rolled back a migration to drop a newly created table. We also introduced more data types that we can use for our models depending on the size and type of information we would like to store. "
